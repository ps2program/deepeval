Let me analyze the LiteLLM implementation to check its compatibility with different model providers:


Search files...
After analyzing the code, I can confirm that our LiteLLM implementation should work with any model supported by LiteLLM, including Ollama, LMStudio, and OpenAI models. Here's why:

1. **Flexible Model Configuration**
   - The implementation accepts any model name through the `model` parameter
   - It supports custom API bases through `api_base`
   - API keys can be provided through parameters or environment variables

2. **Provider Detection**
   - Uses `get_llm_provider()` to automatically detect the provider
   - No hardcoded provider-specific logic
   - Works with any provider that LiteLLM supports

3. **API Compatibility**
   - Uses LiteLLM's unified API interface
   - Handles both synchronous and asynchronous calls
   - Supports schema validation for structured outputs

4. **Cost Calculation**
   - Has a flexible cost calculation system
   - Falls back to token-based calculation if direct cost is not available
   - Handles errors gracefully

5. **Test Coverage**
   - The test file shows it works with LMStudio models
   - Uses a local endpoint (`http://localhost:1234/v1`)
   - Demonstrates compatibility with custom endpoints

Here's an example of how it works with different providers:

```python
# OpenAI
model = LiteLLMModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Ollama
model = LiteLLMModel(
    model="llama2",
    api_base="http://localhost:11434/v1"
)

# LMStudio
model = LiteLLMModel(
    model="Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF",
    api_base="http://localhost:1234/v1"
)

# Custom endpoint
model = LiteLLMModel(
    model="custom-model",
    api_base="https://your-custom-endpoint.com"
)
```

The implementation is designed to be provider-agnostic and should work with any model that:
1. Follows the OpenAI-compatible API format
2. Is supported by LiteLLM
3. Can handle the required parameters (temperature, messages, etc.)

The only potential limitations would be:
1. Some advanced features might not be available for all providers
2. Cost calculation might be approximate for some providers
3. Schema validation might not work with all providers

But for basic text generation and evaluation tasks, it should work seamlessly across all supported providers.
